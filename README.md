## TransGAN Critique - Do Two Transformers Make One Strong GAN?

This project was created as part of the UdeM course IFT6759 Game Theory and ML course (https://gauthiergidel.github.io/courses/game_theory_ML_2021.html). In this project, we evaluate the work of [Jiang et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.07074v2.pdf), who propose TransGAN, a GAN framework which eliminates the use of convolutional operations. Refer to the [report](Report.pdf) and [presentation](Poster.pdf) included in this reporistory for more details.
