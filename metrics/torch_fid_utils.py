"""Calculates the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) to evalulate GANs
The FID metric calculates the distance between two distributions of images.
Typically, we have summary statistics (mean & covariance matrix) of one
of these distributions, while the 2nd distribution is given by a GAN.
When run as a stand-alone program, it compares the distribution of
images that are stored as PNG/JPEG at a specified location with a
distribution given by summary statistics (in pickle format).
The FID is calculated by assuming that X_1 and X_2 are the activations of
the pool_3 layer of the inception net for generated samples and real world
samples respectively.
See --help to see further details.

    Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
    If we examine N-dimensional samples, `X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]^T`,
    then the covariance matrix element `C_{ij}` is the covariance of
    `x_i` and `x_j`. The element `C_{ii}` is the variance of `x_i`.
    Args:
        m: A 1-D or 2-D array containing multiple variables and observations.
            Each row of `m` represents a variable, and each column a single
            observation of all those variables.
        rowvar: If `rowvar` is True, then each row represents a
            variable, with observations in the columns. Otherwise, the
            relationship is transposed: each column represents a variable,
            while the rows contain observations.
